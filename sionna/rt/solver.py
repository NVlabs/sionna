class Solver(SolverBase):

    r"""Solver(scene, solver=None, dtype=tf.complex64)

    Generates propagation paths consisting of the line-of-sight (LoS) paths and
    reflections-only paths for the currently loaded scene.

    The main inputs of the solver are:

    * A set of sources, from which rays are emitted.

    * A set of targets, at which rays are received.

    * A maximum depth, corresponding to the maximum number of reflections. A
    depth of zero corresponds to LoS.

    Generation of paths is carried-out for every link, i.e., for every pair of
    source and target.

    The genration of paths consists in three steps:

    1. A list of candidate paths is generated. A candidate consists in a
    sequence of primitives on which a ray emitted by a source sequentially
    reflects until it reaches a target.

    2. The image method is applied to every candidates (in parallel) to discard
    candidates that do not correspond to valid paths, either because they
    are obstructed by another object in the scene, or because a reflection on
    one of the primitive in the sequence is impossible (reflection point outside
    of the primitive).

    3. For the valid paths, Fresnel coefficients for reflections are computed,
    considering the materials of the intersected objects, to compute transfer
    matrices for every paths.

    The output of the solver consists in, for every valid path that was found:

    * A transfer matrix, which is a 2x2 complex-valued matrix that describes the
    linear transformation incurred by the emitted field. The two dimensions
    correspond to the two polarization components (S and P).

    * A delay

    * Azimuth and zenith angles of arrival

    * Azimuth and zenith angles of departure

    Concerning the first step, two search methods are available for the
    listing of candidates:

    * Exhaustive search, which lists all possible combinations of primitives up
    to the requested maximum depth. This method is deterministic and ensures
    that all paths are found. However, its complexity increases exponentially
    with the number of primitives and with the maximum depth. Therefore, it
    only works for scenes of low complexity and/or for small depth values.

    * Stochastic search, which find candidates by shooting and bouncing rays,
    i.e., by randomly and uniformly sampling directions from the sources at
    which rays are shoot, and bouncing the rays on the intersected primitives
    assuming perfectly specular reflections until the maximum depth is reached.
    The intersected primitives makes the candidate. This method can be applied
    to very large scenes. However, there is no guarantee that all possible
    paths are found.

    Note: Only triangle mesh are supported.

    Parameters
    -----------
    scene : :class:`~sionna.rt.Scene`
        Sionna RT scene

    solver : :class:`~sionna.rt.SolverBase` | None
        Another solver from which to re-use some structures to avoid useless
        compute and memory use

    dtype : tf.complex64 | tf.complex128
        Datatype for all computations, inputs, and outputs.
        Defaults to `tf.complex64`.

    Input
    ------
    max_depth : int
        Maximum depth (i.e., number of bounces) allowed for tracing the
        paths.

    sources : [num_sources, 3], tf.float
        Coordinates of the sources.

    targets : [num_targets, 3], tf.float
        Coordinates of the targets.

    method : str ("exhaustive"|"stochastic")
        Method to be used to list candidate paths.
        The "exhaustive" method uses a
        brute-force approach and considers all possible chains of
        primitives up to ``max_depth``. It can therefore only be used
        for very small scenes.
        The "stochastic" method uses a shoot-and-bounce approach to find
        candidate chains of primitives. This method can be applied to very
        large scenes. However, there is no guarantee that all possible
        paths are found.

    num_samples: int
        Number of random rays to trace in order to generate candidates.
        A large sample count may exhaust GPU memory.

    seed: int
        Controls the random number generator. Using the same seed will
        always result in the same candidates.

    Output
    -------
    paths : Paths
        The simulated paths.
