class AssetObject():
    # pylint: disable=line-too-long
    r"""AssetObject(name, filename, position=(0.,0.,0.), orientation=(0.,0.,0.), radio_material=None, dtype=tf.complex64)

    A class for managing asset objects. An asset is an object that can be added or removed from a scene and which can consist of multiple shapes. 
    When added to a scene, the asset creates SceneObject instances corresponding to each of its mesh shapes. These scene objects can be moved, rotated, 
    and manipulated individually or collectively through the AssetObject.

    The AssetObject keeps track of the corresponding scene objects, allowing for higher-level operations such as moving all shapes of an asset together 
    while maintaining their relative positions and orientations. The asset is associated with an XML file descriptor pointing to one or multiple mesh 
    (.ply) files. A RadioMaterial can be assigned to the asset, which will be applied to all its shapes. If no material is provided, materials will be 
    inferred from the BSDF descriptors in the asset XML file.

    Note: When exporting an asset in Blender with the Mitsuba (Sionna) file format, it's important to set Z-axis as "up" and Y-axis as "forward". 
    This should align the coordinates correctly.

    Example asset can be loaded as follows:

    .. code-block:: Python
        scene = load_scene()
        asset = AssetObject(name='asset_name', filename=sionna.rt.asset_object.test_asset_1)
        scene.add(asset)

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the asset object.

    filename : str
        Path to the asset XML file.

    position : [3], float
        Position :math:`(x,y,z)` as three-dimensional vector.
        Defaults to `None`, in which case the position is not set at init.

    orientation : [3], float | None
        Orientation :math:`(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)` specified
        through three angles corresponding to a 3D rotation
        as defined in :eq:`rotation`.
        This parameter is ignored if ``look_at`` is not `None`.

    look_at : [3], float | :class:`sionna.rt.Object` | :class:`sionna.rt.AssetObject` | None
        A position or the instance of an :class:`~sionna.rt.Object` to
        point toward to.

    radio_material : :class:`~sionna.rt.RadioMaterial`:, optional (default is None)
        If set, the radio material is to be associated with all the asset's shapes. If not specified, materials will be inferred from the BSDF descriptors in the XML file.

    overwrite_scene_bsdfs : :boolean:, optional, (default is False)
        If True replace all existing bsdf from the scene by the ones specified in the asset files. Otherwise, replace only placeholder scene's bsdfs. 
        This argument can be only defined at asset initialisation and has an effect only upon adding the asset to as scene.

    overwrite_scene_radio_materials : :boolean:, optional, (default is False)
        If True update existing radio_material from the scene by the ones specified in the asset files. Otherwise, replace only placeholder scene's radio_materials. 
        This argument can be only defined at asset initialisation and has an effect only upon adding the asset to as scene.
        
    dtype : tf.DType, optional  (default is `tf.complex64`)
        Datatype for all computations, inputs, and outputs.
