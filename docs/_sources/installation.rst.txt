Installation
============

Sionna is composed of three Python modules, namely `Sionna RT <rt/index.html>`_, `Sionna
PHY <phy/index.html>`_, and `Sionna SYS <sys/index.html>`_.

Sionna PHY and Sionna SYS require `Python 3.8-3.12 <https://www.python.org/>`_
and `TensorFlow 2.14-2.19 <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`_. We recommend
Ubuntu 24.04. Earlier versions of TensorFlow may still work but are not
recommended. We refer to the `TensorFlow GPU support
tutorial <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu>`_ for GPU support and the
required driver setup.

`Sionna RT <rt/index.html>`_ has the same requirements as `Mitsuba 3 <https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba3>`_ and we refer to its
`installation guide <https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for further
information. To run Sionna RT on CPU, `LLVM <https://llvm.org>`_ is required by
`Dr.Jit <https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Please check the
`installation instructions for the LLVM
backend <https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what.html#backends>`_.

If you want to run the tutorial notebooks on your machine, you also need
`JupyterLab <https://jupyter.org/>`_. You can alternatively test them on `Google
Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_. Although not necessary, we recommend
running Sionna in a `Docker container <https://www.docker.com>`_ and/or `Python virtual
enviroment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_.

Using pip
---------

The recommended way to install Sionna is via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sionna


If you want to install only Sionna RT, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sionna-rt


If you want to install Sionna without the RT package, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sionna-no-rt

From source
-----------
1. Clone the repository with all submodules:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVlabs/sionna

    If you have already cloned the repository but forgot to set the `--recursive`
    flag, you can correct this via:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git submodule update --init --recursive --remote

2. Install Sionna (including Sionna RT) by running the following command from within the repository's
   root folder:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install ext/sionna-rt/ .
        pip install .

Testing
-------
First, you need to install the test requirements by executing the
following command from the repository's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install '.[test]'

The unit tests can then be executed by running ``pytest`` from within the
``test`` folder.

Documentation
-------------
Install the requirements for building the documentation by running the following
command from the repository's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install '.[doc]'


You might need to install `pandoc <https://pandoc.org>`_ manually.

You can then build the documentation by executing ``make html`` from within the ``doc`` folder.

The documentation can finally be served by any web server, e.g.,

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m http.server --dir build/html


Developing
----------

Development requirements can be installed by executing from the repository's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install '.[dev]'

Linting of the code can be achieved by running ``pylint src/`` from the repository's root directory.
