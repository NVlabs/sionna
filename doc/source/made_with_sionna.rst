    :abstract: Sionna is a GPU-accelerated open-source library for link-level simulations based on TensorFlow. Its latest release (v0.14) integrates a differentiable ray tracer (RT) for the simulation of radio wave propagation. This unique feature allows for the computation of gradients of the channel impulse response and other related quantities with respect to many system  and environment parameters, such as material properties, antenna patterns, array geometries, as well as transmitter and receiver orientations and positions. In this paper, we outline the key components of Sionna RT and showcase example applications such as learning of radio materials and optimizing transmitter orientations by gradient descent. While classic ray tracing is a crucial tool for 6G research topics like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, integrated sensing and communications, as well as user localization, differentiable ray tracing is a key enabler for many novel and exciting research directions, for example, digital twins.

    :title: DUIDD: Deep-Unfolded Interleaved Detection and Decoding for MIMO Wireless Systems
    :authors: Reinhard Wiesmayr, Chris Dick, Jakob Hoydis, Christoph Studer
    :year: 2022
    :version: 0.11
    :link_arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07816

    :abstract: Iterative detection and decoding (IDD) is known to achieve near-capacity performance in multi-antenna wireless systems. We propose deep-unfolded interleaved detection and decoding (DUIDD), a new paradigm that reduces the complexity of IDD while achieving even lower error rates. DUIDD interleaves the inner stages of the data detector and channel decoder, which expedites convergence and reduces complexity. Furthermore, DUIDD applies deep unfolding to automatically optimize algorithmic hyperparameters, soft-information exchange, message damping, and state forwarding. We demonstrate the efficacy of DUIDD using NVIDIA's Sionna link-level simulator in a 5G-near multi-user MIMO-OFDM wireless system with a novel low-complexity soft-input soft-output data detector, an optimized low-density parity-check decoder, and channel vectors from a commercial ray-tracer. Our results show that DUIDD outperforms classical IDD both in terms of block error rate and computational complexity.

    :title: Bit Error and Block Error Rate Training for ML-Assisted Communication
    :authors: Reinhard Wiesmayr, Gian Marti, Chris Dick, Haochuan Song, Christoph Studer
    :year: 2022
    :version: 0.11
    :link_arxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14103.pdf
    :link_github: https://github.com/IIP-Group/BLER_Training
    :abstract: Even though machine learning (ML) techniques are being
               widely used in communications, the question of how to train
               communication systems has received surprisingly little
               attention. In this paper, we show that the commonly used binary
               cross-entropy (BCE) loss is a sensible choice in uncoded
               systems, e.g., for training ML-assisted data detectors, but may
               not be optimal in coded systems. We propose new loss functions
               targeted at minimizing the block error rate and SNR deweighting,
               a novel method that trains communication systems for optimal
               performance over a range of signal-to-noise ratios. The utility
               of the proposed loss functions as well as of SNR deweighting is
               shown through simulations in NVIDIA Sionna.

    :title: Graph Neural Networks for Channel Decoding
    :authors: Sebastian Cammerer, Jakob Hoydis, Fayçal Aït Aoudia, Alexander Keller
    :year: 2022
    :version: 0.11
    :link_arxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14742.pdf

    :link_colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVlabs/gnn-decoder/blob/master/GNN_decoder_standalone.ipynb
    :abstract: We propose a fully differentiable graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture for channel decoding and showcase competitive decoding performance for various coding schemes, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) and BCH codes. The idea is to let a neural network (NN) learn a generalized message passing algorithm over a given graph that represents the forward error correction code structure by replacing node and edge message updates with trainable functions.
