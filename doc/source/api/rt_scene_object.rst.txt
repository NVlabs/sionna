Scene Objects
*************

A scene is made of scene objects. Examples include cars, trees,
buildings, furniture, etc.
A scene object is characterized by its geometry and material (:class:`~sionna.rt.RadioMaterial`)
and implemented as an instance of the :class:`~sionna.rt.SceneObject` class.

Scene objects are uniquely identified by their name.
To access a scene object, the :meth:`~sionna.rt.Scene.get` method of
:class:`~sionna.rt.Scene` may be used.
For example, the following code snippet shows how to load a scene and list its scene objects:

.. code-block:: Python

   scene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.munich)
   print(scene.objects)

To select an object, e.g., named `"Schrannenhalle-itu_metal"`, you can run:

.. code-block:: Python

   my_object = scene.get("Schrannenhalle-itu_metal")

You can then set the :class:`~sionna.rt.RadioMaterial`
of ``my_object`` as follows:

.. code-block:: Python

   my_object.radio_material = "itu_wood"

Most scene objects names have postfixs of the form "-material_name". These are used during loading of a scene
to assign a :class:`~sionna.rt.RadioMaterial` to each of them. This `tutorial video <https://youtu.be/7xHLDxUaQ7c>`_
explains how you can assign radio materials to objects when you create your own scenes.
