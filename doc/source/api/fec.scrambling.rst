Scrambling
**********

The :class:`~sionna.fec.scrambling.Scrambler` module allows to (pseudo)
randomly flip bits in a binary sequence or the signs of a real-valued sequence,
respectively. The :class:`~sionna.fec.scrambling.Descrambler` implement the corresponding descrambling operation.

To simplify distributed graph execution (e.g., by running scrambler and
descrambler in a different sub-graph/device), the scramblers are implemented
stateless. Thus, the internal seed cannot be update on runtime and does not
change after the initialization.
However, if required an explicit random seed can be passed as additional input
the scrambler/descrambler pair when calling the layer.

Further, the :class:`~sionna.fec.scrambling.TB5GScrambler` enables 5G NR compliant
scrambling as specified in [3GPPTS38211_scr]_.

The following code snippet shows how to setup and use an instance of the
scrambler:

.. code-block:: Python

   # set-up system
   scrambler = Scrambler(seed=1234, # an explicit seed can be provided
                        binary=True) # indicate if bits shall be flipped

   descrambler = Descrambler(scrambler=scrambler) # connect scrambler and descrambler

   # --- simplified usage with fixed seed ---
   # c has arbitrary shape and contains 0s and 1s (otherwise set binary=False)
   c_scr = scrambler(c)
   # descramble to reconstruct the original order
   c_descr = descrambler(c_scr)

   # --- advanced usage ---
   # provide explicite seed if a new random seed should be used for each call
   s = tf.random.uniform((), minval=0, maxval=12345678, dtype=tf.int32)

   c_scr = scrambler([c, s])
   c_descr = descrambler([c_scr, s])
